70% TODO list:
    - Handle Dates and Codes for transactions:
        - I would deal with adding these to Transaction.java
        - handle it as well in the controller for creating transactions
        - finally I would pass them as String Properties to the wrapper class
        - this may need some view updating as well

80% TODO list:
    - Let's complete the 70% stuff first!
    - Entire Account Balance:
        - implement the MasterAccount class... this shouldn't be too hard.
    - benefits calculator:
        - we need a view:
            - field to enter a dollar amount
            - radio button to select student/faculty
            - button to process field and display the appropriate value
        - we need a controller:
            - it needs access to the textfield, radio group, and one method for calculating benefits.... no interaction with the model here

    - Users Guide... I believe we have the html done, and just need to figure out how to launch it in a browser when selected
    - drop down list for codes: what are the codes? we need that and to populate it
        - populating codes should be done in the appropriate initialize() controller method

    - information is loaded on startup and saved during execution or shutdown:
        - we mostly have this, logging out saves everything, we just need to duplicate that functionality a bit further

    - Won't accept invalid data in fields: 
        - who knows regular expressions?
