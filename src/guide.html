	<li>You can create a username and password for a new user. Typically, first.last would probably be the best option, but it depends on what you want!</li>
	<li>Description is yours to do with you will, but I would recommend something that will remind you what this person is. (i.e. professor, student, etc).</li>
	<li>Phone and email should be pretty self explanatory; you might find it helpful to use their University information, but fill in what you think is necessary.</li>
