<h2>Handy Dandy Code List</h2>

<h2>Creating Account</h2>
<p>So you need to create an account. Here are some handy tips to make sure that everything gets filled out correctly:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure everything is filled out with the proper information (numbers with numbers, etc)!</li>
	<li>You don't need to worry about the cents (.00), but make sure that there is some number, even if the number is 0.</li>
	<li>Description is yours to do with you will, but I would recommend something that will remind you what this person is. (i.e. professor, student, etc).</li>
	<li>Phone and email should be pretty self explanatory; you might find it helpful to use their University information, but fill in what you think is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Making Transaction</h2>
