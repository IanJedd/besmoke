<p>Today's motivational quote: <i><b>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"</i></b> from Wayne Gretsky <small> and Michael Scott</small>.</p>
<p>If you're reading this, then you're probably in need of assistance, which is what this handy document will help you with!</p>

<h2>Handy Dandy Code List</h2>
<p>While the "Make Transaction" will have the list of codes, as well as an option to add codes as you see fit, here's a quick look at the codes built into the program:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
	<li>This</li>
	<li>Will</li>
	<li>Be</li>
	<li>Filled</li>
	<li>Later</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating Account</h2>
<p>So you need to create an account. Here are some handy tips to make sure that everything gets filled out correctly:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure everything is filled out with the proper information (numbers with numbers, etc)!</li>
	<li>You can create a username and password for a new user. Typically, first.last would probably be the best option, but it depends on what you want!</li>
	<li>Description is yours to do with you will, but I would recommend something that will remind you what this person is. (i.e. professor, student, etc).</li>
	<li>Phone and email should be pretty self explanatory; you might find it helpful to use their University information, but fill in what you think is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Making Transaction</h2>
<p>Ah; the bread and butter of why you're here. You want to keep track of your money! Here are some handy tips to make sure your money isn't misplaced:</p>
<ol>
	<li>There is a section to select a code, to make it easier when you need to know what you spent the money on. You do have to add the codes in first, however.</li>
	<li>To do that, just enter it into the "New Code" spot and it will save it for you!</li>
	<li>If you're making a deposit, please only check "CC Deposit" or "Check Deposit". Don't worry; the fees will be taken out and show up in your main area depending on what you click.</li>
</ol>
